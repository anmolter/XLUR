<h1>Installation</h1>
<p>System requirements: Windows 10, ArcGIS Pro v2.2.4 or higher</p>
<p>The PyLUR tools require a small number of additional Python packages to be installed. In ArcGIS Pro this can be done using the Python Package Manager. Follow these steps to install additional Python packages:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Open ArcGIS Pro. Click the About ArcGIS Pro button in the bottom left corner (denoted by the red arrow in the screenshot below). <em>In ArcGIS Pro v.2.3 this button is called Settings.</em></li>
</ol>
<p><img src="Images/manager1.jpg" /></p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In the menu on the left hand side click Python. This will open the Python Package Manager. Click the Manage Environments button.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="Images/manager2a.jpg" /></p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>This will open the Manage Environments window. Since additional packages cannot be installed in the default environment, you will need to clone the default environment. Ensure that the default environment is selected (this is typically called ‘arcgispro-py3’), then click clone.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="Images/manager3.JPG" /></p>
<p>Creating the cloned environment may take a while, a blue line at the bottom of the window indicates that the process is still running. Once the clone has been created, click the radio button to make it the active environment. Click Close, then Exit ArcGIS Pro and restart it for the changes to take effect.</p>
<p><img src="Images/manager3_1.jpg" /></p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Restart ArcGIS Pro, click on About ArcGIS Pro, then click on Python in the menu on the left hand side. Under Project Environment you should see the name of the cloned environment. <em>If you do not see the name of the cloned environment, repeat step 3 being careful not to exit the programme until the clone has been created.</em> Click Add Packages.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="Images/manager4.JPG" /></p>
<p>This opens the Add Packages interface. In the Search box type patsy. The patsy package should appear in the list below. Select the patsy package and click Install.</p>
<p><img src="Images/manager4a.jpg" /></p>
<p>This will open the Install Package window. Tick the box in the bottom left to agree to the terms and conditions, then click Install.</p>
<p><img src="Images/manager4b.jpg" /></p>
<p>The installation may take a while. Once the installation is finished, the list underneath Add Packages will refresh. If you scroll down the list, you will see that patsy is no longer on it (because it has been installed). If you want to check that the package has been installed, click on Installed Packages. If you scroll down the list of installed packages, patsy should be listed.</p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Repeat step 4 for the following packages:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>statsmodels</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="Images/manager4c.jpg" /></p>
<ul>
<li>seaborn</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="Images/manager4d.jpg" /></p>
<ul>
<li>wxpython</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="Images/manager4e.jpg" /></p>
<p>After these four packages have been installed, click the back arrow in the menu on the left hand side.</p>
<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Click Open another project, browse to the PyLUR.aprx ArcGIS Pro Project file and double-click to open it. The PyLUR.aprx file can be found in the PyLUR folder in the PyLUR repository. In the Catalog window double-click Toolboxes, then double-click PyLUR.tbx. This will open the PyLUR toolbox, which contains the BuildLUR and ApplyLUR scripts. Running either of these script will open the Build LUR or Apply LUR wizard, respectively.</li>
</ol>

<h1>General Information</h1>
<div id="what-is-lur" class="section level2">
<h2>What is LUR?</h2>
<p>Land use regression (LUR) is a statistical method, which uses geospatial data to develop prediction models in environmental sciences. It is predominantly used in air pollution research to predict pollutant concentrations empirically within a given a study area. However, it has also been used for other environmental phenomena such as noise, air temperature and water microbiology.</p>
<p>The underlying principle of LUR is that a measured quantity (e.g. pollutant concentration, noise level, temperature etc) at a given location depends on characteristics of the surrounding environment, in particular on the presence and absence of sources and sinks, which increase and decrease values respectively.</p>
<p>LUR models are developed by using measured data from a number of monitoring sites as the dependent variable and data on the surrounding environment extracted as predictor variables in a multiple linear regression analysis. For example, in an air pollution study particulate matter concentrations might be measured at fifty monitoring sites. Then for each monitoring site potential predictor variables are extracted such as the area of industrial land use around the monitoring site, the distance to the nearest road, the number of motor vehicles on the nearest road etc. The particulate matter concentrations and the potential predictors are entered into a supervised machine learning process, which will try to construct a parsimonious multiple linear regression model. This model can then be used to predict particulate matter concentrations at any point within the study area.</p>
<p>Hybrid models can also be developed. In the PyLUR tool a hybrid model is a model in which one or more mandatory variables are selected by the user. These mandatory variables are forced into the model, regardless of the amount of variance that they explain or their direction of effect. An example of this would be using the output from dispersion models run at a coarse spatial resolution as a mandatory variable, which could add a measure of global variability to the measures of local variability used in LUR.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-pylur-wizard" class="section level2">
<h2>The PyLUR Wizard</h2>
<p>The PyLUR wizard guides the user through building and applying LUR models from within the ArcGIS software. The user must complete each input field in the wizard starting at the top of the page and then moving downwards. The statusbar at the bottom of wizard indicates if an input field is ready for an entry or if it is currently being processed. <em>Some inputs may take a while to be processed.</em> Once an input has been completed a green tick mark will appear next to it. Clicking on the question mark button next to each section heading will open a help window with further information on how to complete each section. The user may exit the wizard at any time by clicking on the Cancel button; however, all progress made in the wizard will be lost.</p>
<p>The wizard window can be resized by dragging the sides or by clicking on the maximise button in the title bar.</p>
<p><img src="Images/wizard_features.png" /></p>
<p>There are three types of windows that may appear during the process of completing the wizard.</p>
<div id="information-windows" class="section level3">
<h3>Information Windows</h3>
<p><img src="Images/example_info.jpg" /></p>
<p>Information windows simply confirm a choice made by the user. They are non-critical.</p>
</div>
<div id="warning-windows" class="section level3">
<h3>Warning Windows</h3>
<p><img src="Images/example_warning.jpg" /></p>
<p>A warning window highlights a potential problem in the dataset selected by the user. This problem may be critical or non-critical and it is up to the user to decide whether to proceed.</p>
</div>
<div id="error-windows" class="section level3">
<h3>Error Windows</h3>
<p><img src="Images/example_error.jpg" /></p>
<p>An error window indicates that an incorrect entry has been made into an input field, that an invalid selection has been made or that a dataset has a critical problem. This is a critical problem and needs to be addressed before proceeding with the wizard. In some cases, for example if the dataset has a critical problem, the user may need to exit the wizard, address the problem and then start afresh.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="how-does-pylur-work" class="section level2">
<h2>How does PyLUR work?</h2>
<p>PyLUR is written in Python. It consists of two script tools, BuildLUR and ApplyLUR, which are stored in the PyLUR toolbox in the PyLUR project. The diagram below provides an overview of the architecture and process flow associated with each tool.</p>
<p><img src="Images/architecture.png" /></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="data-preparation" class="section level1 tabset tabset-pills">
<h1>Data Preparation</h1>
<p>It is essential to prepare the data carefully prior to using PyLUR. PyLUR will carry out some very basic checks of the data, i.e. it will check that features are located within the study area and if necessary display a warning message. <strong>PyLUR will not clean or prepare the data for use in the BuildLUR wizard.</strong> Users should carefully check all feature classes and raster files that they intend to use. In particular, feature classes should be checked for spatial duplicates (e.g. using the Find Identical and Delete Identical tools) and invalid geometries (e.g. using the Check Geometry and Repair Geometry tools).</p>
<p>To be used by the BuildLUR tool all feature classes and raster files must be stored in <strong>the same File Geodatabase</strong>.</p>
<p>The following tabs show further information for different input datasets.</p>
<div id="study-area" class="section level2">
<h2>Study Area</h2>
<p>The file geodatabase must contain a <strong>polygon feature class</strong> that represents the boundaries of the study area.</p>
<p>This feature class <strong>must contain</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>exactly one feature, which as a minimum encompasses all of the monitoring sites.</li>
</ul>
<p>Typically, a feature class of administrative boundaries is used to define the study area. For example, the red polygon below shows the boundary of the Greater Manchester administrative area. If no such feature class is available, it can be created, either manually or by using the Minimum Bounding Geometry Tool.</p>
<p><img src="Images/GM_area.JPG" /></p>
</div>
<div id="dependent-variable" class="section level2">
<h2>Dependent Variable</h2>
<p>The file geodatabase must contain a <strong>point feature class</strong> of the monitoring sites, which will be used as the dependent variable when building the LUR model. Each row in this feature class must be a unique location, i.e. there must be no spatial duplicates.</p>
<p>The point feature class <strong>must contain</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a text field with a unique identifier for each monitoring site.</p></li>
<li><p>one or more numeric fields with monitored values (e.g. pollutant concentrations, temperatures, bacterial counts).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The table below shows an example of an attribute table of a monitoring sites feature class. The feature class may contain other fields. These will be ignored during the analysis, but they may slow down the performance of the PyLUR tools.</p>
<p><img src="Images/Example_DepVar.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<div id="predictor-variables" class="section level2 tabset tabset-pills">
<h2>Predictor Variables</h2>
<p>Predictor variables can be derived from both vector data and raster data. Multiple predictor variables can be derived from a single vector dataset, depending on additional criteria such as the number of buffers, attribute categories and aggregation methods. In contrast, only a single predictor can be derived from a raster dataset. To build a LUR model, typically hundreds of potential predictor variables are extracted and then assessed in the statistical analysis. Technically, the BuildLUR tool can be run with only one predictor, but the resulting model will be very limited.</p>
<div id="vector-maps" class="section level3 tabset tabset-pills">
<h3>Vector maps</h3>
<p>From vector data predictor variables can be extracted based on circular buffers around the monitoring sites or based on the distance to the nearest feature. Each of these methods can be applied to polygon, line or point vector data.</p>
<div id="buffer-based-predictors" class="section level4">
<h4>Buffer based Predictors</h4>
<p>PyLUR will draw one or more circular buffers around each monitoring site (the radius of the buffer is determined by the user). It will then use the Intersect tool to extract features and their associated attributes from a polygon, line or point feature class selected by the user. Geometric attributes are automatically recalculated.</p>
<p>This feature class <strong>must contain</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>a text field which identifies the category that each feature belongs to. For example, a polygon feature class of land use would contain a text field that identifies which land use category (e.g. residential, commercial, industrial) each polygon feature belongs to. A road feature class would contain a text field that identifies the road type (e.g. motorway, primary, secondary) of each line feature. A tree feature class might contain a text field that shows the species of each point feature. The text of the category field will be used as part of the variable naming schema, for details of the name schema see Step 3 - Predictors. Any whitespace or underscores in the text of the category field will be removed.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="Images/Example_Buffer1.png" /></p>
<p>If the features of the feature class cannot be categorised, then a text field should be used in which all features have the same value. For example, a polygon feature class of population density would not need a category; therefore a “dummy” text field should be added with identical values. In a line feature class of roads it may also be useful to analyse all roads as well as roads by category, therefore to this feature class an additional text field could be added in which all fields are set to “all”. The tables below show some examples of “dummy” category fields.</p>
<p><img src="Images/Example_Buffer2.png" /></p>
<p>The feature class <strong>may contain</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>one or more numeric fields showing attribute values for each feature. If the chosen aggregation method is total area, total length or point count, a numeric field is not required. However, if the chosen aggregation method is area weighted value, area*value, length weighted value, length*value, sum of values, mean of values or median of values, then the feature class must contain at least one numeric field (see <em>Build LUR Step 3 - Predictors</em> for further information on aggregation methods). For example, a line feature class of roads may contain one or more fields showing traffic counts for each feature (line segment or row in the attribute table). A point feature class of chimney stacks may contain a field showing emission rates for each feature. The attribute tables below show some examples of value fields.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="Images/Example_Buffer3.png" /></p>
</div>
<div id="distance-based-predictors" class="section level4">
<h4>Distance based Predictors</h4>
<p>PyLUR will identify the nearest polygon, line or point feature to each monitoring site point location from a feature class selected by the user The nearest feature is based on the Euclidean (straight line) distance and is expressed in the map units defined by the coordinate system specified the BuildLUR tool. Depending on the chosen method it will calculate the distance to the nearest feature, provide the value of an attribute of the nearest feature (e.g. traffic flow) or calculate a combination of these two.</p>
<p>The feature class <strong>may contain</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>one or more numeric fields showing attribute values for each feature. If the chosen method is distance, inverse distance or inverse distance squared, then a numeric field is not required. However, if the chosen method is value, value*distance, value*inverse distance or value*inverse distance squared, then the feature class must contain at least one numeric field. For example, a line feature class of roads may contain one or more fields showing traffic counts for each feature (line segment or row in attribute table). A point feature class of chimney stacks may contain a field showing emission rates for each feature. The attribute tables below show some examples of value fields.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="Images/Example_Distance1.png" /></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="raster-maps" class="section level3 tabset tabset-pills">
<h3>Raster maps</h3>
<p>From raster data only the value of the raster cell that is spatially coincident with the monitoring site point can be extracted. Since standard raster grids can only hold one value per cell, no table schema is required.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="build-lur" class="section level1 tabset tabset-pills">
<h1>Build LUR</h1>

    step 3 (Predictors) of the wizard will be imported into the <em>LURdata</em> feature dataset prior to analysis. This ensures that all feature classes used in the analysis have the same spatial reference. Raster
    files will be projected into the specified coordinate system prior to analysis, due to the fact that they cannot be imported into a feature dataset.</p>
  <p>ESRI uses the Well-Known ID (WKID) to define the spatial reference. Use <a href="https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/map/projections/pdf/projected_coordinate_systems.pdf">this link</a>
    to find the WKID of the projected coordinate system of your choice. For example the British National Grid is WKID:27700.</p>
  <p>Click the <span style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#040404; background-color:#C4C4C4; padding:0px 2px">OK</span> button. If a valid WKID has been entered, the name of the
    selected coordinate system will be shown. Click the <span style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#040404; background-color:#C4C4C4; padding:0px 2px">OK</span> button and a green
    tick mark will appear.</p>
  <p style="border:2px; border-style:solid; border-color:#FF0000;background-color:#ffcccc; padding:5px">The unit of the coordinate system will determine the unit of the buffer distances. For example, if
    the coordinate system is defined in metres, then the buffer distances need to be specified in metres. If the coordinate system is defined in feet, then the buffer distances need to be specified
    in feet.</p>

<h2>Step 3 - Predictors</h2>
<p>In this step the predictor or independent variables of the regression analysis are specified.</p>
<p>Predictor variables can be derived from vector data and from raster data. From vector data predictor variables can be extracted based on circular buffers around the monitoring site point locations or based on the distance to the nearest feature. Since vector data can be polygons, lines or points, this results in six possible types of predictor variables. From raster data only the value of the raster cell that is spatially coincident with the monitoring site point can be extracted, adding one more possible type of predictor. Therefore, in total seven types of predictor variables can be extracted and entered into the statistical analysis. Each type of variable can produce multiple predictors, depending on additional settings such as the number of buffer distances, the number of categories within a feature class, or the aggregation/extraction method specified.</p>

<div id="buffer-based-predictors-1" class="section level3 tabset tabset-pills">
<h3>Buffer based Predictors</h3>
<div id="polygon-area-or-value-within-buffer" class="section level4 tabset tabset-pills">
<h4>Polygon Area or Value within Buffer</h4>
<p>For this type of variable a polygon feature class should be used, which has a spatial extent that is larger than: the study area + the largest buffer distance. The polygon feature class should not contain duplicates or invalid geometries (if uncertain about invalid geometries, run the Repair Geometries tool prior to running the wizard). The polygon feature class must contain a text field, which identifies a category for each polygon. If the feature class contains only one category, a dummy text field should be created with all rows set to the same value.</p>
<p><strong>Polygon Area within Buffer</strong></p>
<p><img src="Images/PolyInBuffer_MultCategories.jpg" width="500px" height="500px" /></p>
<p>This example diagram is based on a polygon feature class with four categories (A,B,C,D). For a given buffer distance the wizard will calculate the total area (in the squared map unit of the projected coordinate system) of each category within the buffer, e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>Total area of category A = Area of A<sub>1</sub> + Area of A<sub>2</sub> + Area A<sub>3</sub></li>
<li>Total area of category B = Area of B<sub>1</sub> + Area of B<sub>2</sub> + Area B<sub>3</sub></li>
<li>Total area of category C = Area of C<sub>1</sub> + Area of C<sub>2</sub> + Area C<sub>3</sub></li>
<li>Total area of category D = Area of D<sub>1</sub> + Area of D<sub>2</sub> + Area D<sub>3</sub> + Area D<sub>4</sub></li>
</ul>
<p>A real life example of this variable type would be a polygon feature class of land use. Each category would contain a different type of land use, for example residential, industrial, natural etc. Total land areas of each land use category within the circular buffer would be produced, e.g. in m<sup>2</sup> for the British National Grid.</p>
<p><strong>Polygon Value within Buffer</strong></p>
<p><img src="Images/PolyInBuffer_MultCatValue.jpg" width="500px" height="500px" /></p>
<p>This example diagram is based on a polygon feature class with four categories (A,B,C,D) and each polygon has a numeric value attribute (“Value”). For a given buffer distance the wizard will calculate the total area weighted value for each category within the buffer, e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>Total area weighted value of category A = ((Area of A<sub>1</sub> inside buffer ÷ Total Area of A<sub>1</sub>) × Value of A<sub>1</sub>) + ((Area of A<sub>2</sub> inside buffer ÷ Total Area of A<sub>2</sub>) × Value of A<sub>2</sub>)</li>
<li>Total area weighted value of category B = ((Area of B<sub>1</sub> inside buffer ÷ Total Area of B<sub>1</sub>) × Value of B<sub>1</sub>) + ((Area of B<sub>2</sub> inside buffer ÷ Total Area of B<sub>2</sub>) × Value of B<sub>2</sub>)</li>
<li>Total area weighted value of category C = ((Area of C<sub>1</sub> inside buffer ÷ Total Area of C<sub>1</sub>) × Value of C<sub>1</sub>) + ((Area of C<sub>2</sub> inside buffer ÷ Total Area of C<sub>2</sub>) × Value of C<sub>2</sub>)</li>
<li>Total area weighted value of category D = ((Area of D<sub>1</sub> inside buffer ÷ Total Area of D<sub>1</sub>) × Value of D<sub>1</sub>) + ((Area of D<sub>2</sub> inside buffer ÷ Total Area of D<sub>2</sub>) × Value of D<sub>2</sub>)</li>
</ul>
<p>A real life example of this variable type would be a polygon feature class of population density.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the wizard can calculate the total sum of the product of the polygon area and the polygon value, e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>Total sum of product of area and value of category A = (Area of A<sub>1</sub> inside buffer × Value of A<sub>1</sub>) + (Area of A<sub>2</sub> inside buffer × Value of A<sub>2</sub>)</li>
<li>Total sum of product of area and value of category B = (Area of B<sub>1</sub> inside buffer × Value of B<sub>1</sub>) + (Area of B<sub>2</sub> inside buffer × Value of B<sub>2</sub>)</li>
<li>Total sum of product of area and value of category C = (Area of C<sub>1</sub> inside buffer × Value of C<sub>1</sub>) + (Area of C<sub>2</sub> inside buffer × Value of C<sub>2</sub>)</li>
<li>Total sum of product of area and value of category D = (Area of D<sub>1</sub> inside buffer × Value of D<sub>1</sub>) + (Area of D<sub>2</sub> inside buffer × Value of D<sub>2</sub>)</li>
</ul>
<p>A real life example of this variable type would be a polygon feature class of area emission sources such as fugitive emissions from land use categories based on different estimated car parking densities. Another example is anthropogenic heat emissions from different residential land uses depending on housing characteristics and estimated energy use.</p>

</ul>
<p>A real life example of this variable type would be a line feature class of traffic counts.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the wizard can calculate the total sum of the product of the line length and the line value, e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>Total sum of product of length and value of category A = (Length of A<sub>1</sub> inside buffer × Value of A<sub>1</sub>) + (Length of A<sub>2</sub> inside buffer × Value of A<sub>2</sub>)</li>

<h4>Point Count or Value within Buffer</h4>
<p>For this type of variable a point feature class should be used, which has a spatial extent that is larger than: the study area + the largest buffer distance. The point feature class should not contain duplicates. The point feature class must contain a text field, which identifies a category for each point. If the feature class contains only one category, a dummy text field should be created with all rows set to the same value.</p>
<p><strong>Point Count within Buffer</strong></p>
<p><img src="Images/PointInBuffer_MultCat.jpg" width="500px" height="500px" /></p>
<p>This example diagram is based on a point feature class with three categories (A,B,C). For a given buffer distance the wizard will count the number of points belonging to each category within the buffer, e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>Total count of category A = {A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>}</li>
<li>Total count of category B = {B<sub>1</sub> }</li>
<li>Total count of category C = {C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>}</li>
</ul>
<p>A real life example of this variable type would be a point feature class of trees. Each category would contain a different tree species, for example <em>Quercus robur, Fagus sylvatica, Cornus sanguinea</em> etc.The count would therefore be the number of individuals of each species within the buffer. Another example would be the count of particular stacks (chimneys) used as a proxy of emission rates.</p>
<p><strong>Point Value within Buffer</strong></p>
<p><img src="Images/PointInBuffer_MultValue.jpg" width="500px" height="500px" /></p>
<p>This example diagram is based on a point feature class with three categories (A,B,C) and each point has a numeric value. For a given buffer distance the wizard will calculate the sum of values for each category within the buffer, e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sum of values of category A = Value of A<sub>1</sub> + Value of A<sub>2</sub></li>
<li>Sum of values of category B = Value of B<sub>1</sub></li>
<li>Sum of values of category C = Value of C<sub>1</sub> + Value of C<sub>2</sub></li>
</ul>
<p>A real life example of this variable type would be a point feature class of chimney stacks with different emission rates (e.g. grammes of NOx per hour).</p>
<p>Alternatively, the wizard can calculate the mean or median of the values, e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mean of values of category A = (Value of A<sub>1</sub> + Value of A<sub>2</sub>) ÷ Number of points within buffer belonging to category A</li>
<li>Mean of values of category B = Value of B<sub>1</sub> ÷ Number of points within buffer belonging to category B</li>
<li>Mean of values of category C = (Value of C<sub>1</sub> + Value of C) ÷ Number of points within buffer belonging to category C<sub>2</sub></li>
</ul>
<p>A real life example of this variable type would be tree height.</p>

<h3>Distance based Predictors</h3>
<div id="distance-to-andor-value-of-nearest-polygon" class="section level4 tabset tabset-pills">
<h4>Distance to and/or Value of nearest Polygon</h4>
<p>For this type of variable a polygon feature class should be used, which ideally has a spatial extent that is larger than the study area. The polygon feature class must not contain spatial duplicates or invalid geometries (if uncertain about invalid geometries, run the Repair Geometries tool prior to running the wizard).</p>
<p><img src="Images/PolygonDistance.jpg" /></p>
<p>This example diagram shows a feature class of non-contiguous polygons with different values for each feature. For each each point feature representing a monitoring site the wizard will identify the nearest polygon and calculate one or more of the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distance = The distance to the nearest polygon edge (in the map unit of the projected coordinate system)</li>
<li>Inverse distance = 1 ÷ distance to the nearest polygon edge</li>
<li>Inverse distance squared = 1 ÷ (distance to the nearest polygon edge)<sup>2</sup></li>
<li>Value = The value of the nearest polygon</li>
<li>Value * Distance = The value of the nearest polygon × the distance to the nearest polygon edge</li>
<li>Value * Inverse distance = The value of the nearest polygon × (1 ÷ distance to the nearest polygon edge)</li>
<li>Value * Inverse distance squared = The value of the nearest polygon × (1 ÷ (distance to the nearest polygon edge)<sup>2</sup>)</li>
</ul>
<p>A real life example of this variable type would be proximity to water bodies with the potential to reduce air temperatures monitored at weather stations or the impact of fugitive emission sources from industrial sites on air quality. Inverse squared distance values are useful to represent the importance of distance, i.e. to give greater importance to nearby polygon features compared with those further away. A Value attribute field might be useful if the size of the feature is important, e.g. livestock densities on agricultural land parcels in the case of ambient ammonia concentrations.</p>
<style>
div.red {border:2px; border-style:solid; border-color:#FF0000; background-color:#ffcccc; padding:5px;}
</style>
<div class="red">
<p>If the monitoring site is located on top of a polygon (i.e. the distance is zero) the Inverse distance, Inverse distance squared, Value * Inverse Distance, and Value * Inverse distance squared options will produce a division by zero error and the result for the feature will be set to <strong>missing</strong>. The Distance and Value * Distance options will produce a result of <strong>zero</strong>. Therefore, the user should carefully inspect the data prior to using these options.</p>

  <h1 style="color:#4485b8; font-size:150%;font-weight:normal;">Set Direction of Effect</h1>
  <h2 style="font-size:125%;font-weight:normal;">Define Direction of Effect</h2>
  <p>For each row in this box select whether the predictor variable is expected to have a positive or a negative direction of effect. The user has to make an <em>a priori</em> assumption for each
    predictor variable: a positive direction of effect is a predictor variable that will increase the value of the dependent variable, i.e. it is considered to be a source of the dependent variable
    and the beta coefficient is expected to be positive. A negative direction of effect is a predictor variable that will decrease the value of the dependent variable, i.e. it is considered to be
    a sink of the dependent variable and the beta coefficient is expected to be negative. These specifications will be used as model selection criteria in the statistical analysis; therefore, the user
    must consider carefully whether each predictor variable has a positive or a negative direction of effect. <strong>Incorrect specifications will lead to incorrect LUR models!</strong>
  <p>For example, the distance to a polygon that will increase the dependent variable (i.e. a source polygon) is assumed to have a negative direction of effect (i.e. it is expected to have a
    negative coefficient),
    because as distance increases the value of the predictor variable increases, while the actual effect of the polygon decreases. Conversely, the inverse distance and inverse distance squared
    to a polygon that will increase the dependent variable is assumed to have a positive direction of effect, because as distance increases the calculated
    value (i.e. 1/distance) of the predictor variable becomes smaller, as does the effect of the polygon.</p>
  <p>After all predictor variables in the list have been defined as either positive or negative, click
    the <span style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#040404; background-color:#C4C4C4; padding:0px 2px">Done</span> button. A green tick mark will appear and the

<div id="distance-to-andor-value-of-nearest-line" class="section level4 tabset tabset-pills">
<h4>Distance to and/or Value of nearest Line</h4>
<p>For this type of variable a line feature class should be used, which ideally has a spatial extent that is larger than the study area. The line feature class must not contain spatial duplicates.</p>
<p><img src="Images/LineDistance.jpg" /></p>
<p>This example diagram shows a line feature class with different values for each feature. For each point feature representing a monitoring site loaction the wizard will identify the nearest line and calculate one or more of the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distance = The distance to the nearest line (in the map unit of the projected coordinate system)</li>
<li>Inverse distance = 1 ÷ distance to the nearest line</li>
<li>Inverse distance squared = 1 ÷ (distance to the nearest line)<sup>2</sup> - Value = The value of the nearest line</li>
<li>Value * Distance = The value of the nearest line × the distance to the nearest line</li>
<li>Value * Inverse distance = The value of the nearest line × (1 ÷ distance to the nearest line)</li>
<li>Value * Inverse distance squared = The value of the nearest line × (1 ÷ (distance to the nearest line)<sup>2</sup>)</li>
</ul>
<p>A real life example of this variable type would be proximity to the nearest road feature to represent the potential for higher ambient air pollutant concentrations due to vehicular emissions or proximity to the nearest river to represent the potential for lower air temperatures at nearby weather stations. Inverse squared distance values are useful to represent the importance of distance, i.e. to give greater importance to nearby line features compared with those further away. A Value attribute field might be useful if the size of the feature is important, e.g. roads with an attribute representing traffic volume.</p>
<div class="red">
<p>If the monitoring site is located on top of a line (i.e. the distance is zero) the Inverse distance, Inverse distance squared, Value * Inverse Distance, and Value * Inverse distance squared options will produce a division by zero error and the result for the feature will be set to <strong>missing</strong>. The Distance and Value * Distance options will produce a result of <strong>zero</strong>. Therefore, the user should carefully inspect the data prior to using these options.</p>

  <h2 style="font-size:125%;font-weight:normal;">Define Direction of Effect</h2>
  <p>For each row in this box select whether the predictor variable is expected to have a positive or a negative direction of effect. The user has to make an <em>a priori</em>
    assumption for each predictor variable: a positive direction of effect is a predictor variable that will increase the value of the dependent variable, i.e. it is considered
    to be a source of the dependent variable and the beta coefficient is expected to be positive. A negative direction of effect is a predictor variable that will decrease the
    value of the dependent variable, i.e. it is considered to be a sink of the dependent variable and the beta coefficient is expected to be negative. These specifications will
    be used as model selection criteria in the statistical analysis; therefore, the user
    must consider carefully whether each predictor variable has a positive or a negative direction of effect. <strong>Incorrect specifications will lead to incorrect LUR models!</strong>
  <p>For example, the distance to a point that will increase the dependent variable (i.e. a source point) is assumed to have a negative direction of effect (i.e. it is expected to have a
    negative coefficient), because as distance increases the value of the predictor variable
    increases, while the actual effect of the point decreases. Conversely, the inverse distance and inverse distance squared to a point that will increase the dependent variable
    is assumed to have a positive direction of effect, because as distance increases the calculated
    value (i.e. 1/distance) of the predictor variable becomes smaller, as does the effect of the point.</p>
  <p>After all predictor variables in the list have been defined as either positive or negative, click
    the <span style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#040404; background-color:#C4C4C4; padding:0px 2px">Done</span> button. A green tick mark will appear and the

<li><strong>Set Direction of Effect</strong>
<ul>
<li>The box next to Define Direction of Effect is automatically populated with the names of the predictor variables that will be created. In this case the variable name includes the name that was entered at the top of the page (landuseArea), the names of the land use categories (HDres,Industry,LDres,Natural,UrbGreen,Port), the buffer distances (100,300,500,1000,5000), and the aggregation method (sum indicates that the total area within the buffer will be used). For each predictor variable you must now select whether the <em>a priori</em> assumed direction of effect of the predictor is positive or negative. This is a critical step, for further information on this click the help button. In an air pollution study it is usually assumed that urban and industrial land uses increase pollution levels, i.e. their direction of effect will be positive, while natural land uses decrease pollution levels, i.e. their direction of effect will be negative. Scroll through the list of predictor variables and set all HDres, Industry, LDres, and Port variables to Positive. Set all Natural and UrbGreen variables to Negative, then click done.</li>

<p>Click Next &gt; to continue. The Predictors page will open again (this may take a while). You can see that in the box below Predictors Added the new predictors have been added together with their assumed direction of effect.</p>
<p>You will now create predictors that show oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emitted from the area within buffers surrounding the monitoring sites. Data on NOx emission rates comes in different formats and for this predictor variable you will use emission rates aggregated at an area level (in this case regular square polygons). Since the buffers do not match the emission polygons exactly, the emission rate values need to be area weighted.</p>

<li>Under Aggregation Method select Area weighted value.</li>
<li>From the dropdown menu next to Value Field select NOxEmission.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Set Direction of Effect</strong>
<ul>
<li>The box next to Define Direction of Effect shows the names of the predictor variables that will be created. For these variables the name includes the name that was entered at the top of the page (EmissionAreaWt), the name in the dummy category (All), the buffer distances (100,300,500,1000,5000), and the aggregation method (wtv indicates that an area weighted value will be used). This type of predictor variable represents emission rates of pollution, therefore its direction of effect is obviously assumed to be positive. Scroll through the list of predictor variables and set all variables to Positive, then click done.</li>

<h3>Distance to and/or value of nearest Polygon</h3>
<p>Through this page you will create potential predictor variables that show the distance from each monitoring site to the nearest polygon, or the value of the nearest polygon or a combination of the distance and the value. As shown above NOx emission sources can be processed in different formats: as point sources or aggregated to an area level (as square polygons). For the purpose of this tutorial you will extract an area level emission rate for each monitoring site, which will be the emission rate of the polygon that the monitoring site is located on.</p>

</div>
<div id="distance-to-andor-value-of-nearest-line-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Distance to and/or value of nearest Line</h3>
<p>Through this page you will create potential predictor variables that show the distance from each monitoring site to the nearest line, or the value of the nearest line or a combination of the distance and the value. For this tutorial you will extract the distance, inverse distance and inverse distance squared from each monitoring site to the nearest major road.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Set Variable Name</strong>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Set Input Data</strong>
<ul>
<li>From the dropdown menu next to Line Feature Class select OSM_MajorRoads.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Set Direction of Effect</strong>
<ul>
<li>The further away a monitoring site is from a road the less it will be influenced by emissions from traffic on the road. This means as distance increases, pollution levels will decrease; therefore, you should set the direction of effect of the Distance variable to Negative. The inverse distance is 1 divided by the distance, while the inverse distance squared is 1 divided by the squared distance. This means as the distance becomes larger the inverse distance and inverse distance squared become smaller and so do the pollution levels. Therefore, you should set the direction for the Inverse distance and Inverse distance squared variables to Positive, then click Done. It is usually not necessary to use both the Distance and the Inverse distance, as they are functions of each other. However, for the purpose of this tutorial both are included to illustrate the fact that they have opposite directions of effects.</li>

<h2>Model</h2>
<p>This is the final page of the Build LUR wizard. On this page you need to choose the type of model that you would like to build, before you finally build the model.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Export data (optional)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Click the Export button. This will save the dependent variable and potential predictor variables in text file. This file is formatted so that it can be read by most statistical software, which allows users with statistical expertise to run their own analyses on the data.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Build LUR model</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Under Type of model you can choose between building a classic model or a hybrid model. For the purpose of this tutorial select Classic LUR. For further information on the difference between classic and hybrid models click the help button.</li>
<li>Click Build model. Depending on the amount of data entered building the model may take several minutes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The completed page should look like this:</p>
<p><img src="Images/Example_P4.png" style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#8c8c8c;" /></p>
<p>Click Finish.</p>
<p>Go to the directory of your output folder. Inside this folder you should see a new folder with the project name that you chose on the Settings page followed by a date and time stamp. Inside this new folder are the databases and files created by Build LUR:</p>
<p><img src="Images/Example_outputfolder.png" style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#8c8c8c;" /></p>
<p>Open the lur_var_data_[Date_Time].csv file. This is the text file that you exported on the Model page, which contains the dependent variable and all potential predictor variables. Scroll to the right and find the pD_EmissionAreaVal_NOxEmission_val variable and the pG_EmAreaRaster_raster_val variable. The values of these two variables are identical, which confirms that the value of nearest polygon and value of raster cell methods produced the same result when run on the same data.</p>
<p>Open the LOG_[Date_Time].txt file. This text file records all entries made into the Build LUR wizard, any warning or error messages, and the model development process. Scroll through this file until you find Predictor variables created. This lists all of the variables created through the Predictors pages of the wizard. You may notice that some variables are missing, e.g. pA_landuseArea_Port_100_sum is not there even though a buffer distance of 100 was specified for all land use categories. The missing variable is due to the fact that no Port land use area was found within any of the 100m buffers around the monitoring sites. Similarly, pC_EmissionPoint_Chemical_1000_sum, pC_EmissionPoint_Chemical_500_sum, pC_EmissionPoint_Chemical_300_sum, and pC_EmissionPoint_Chemical_100_sum are missing, because no point emission source from the chemical sector was present in the 1000m, 500m, 300m, or 100m buffers.</p>
<p>Scrolling down further through the file shows that a file of descriptive statistics was created in the output folder. This file shows the mean, median and variability of all dependent and predictor variables. In addition, a correlation matrix of all variables was created and stored in the output folder.</p>
<p>The next section shows details of the machine learning process used to develop the LUR model. PyLUR uses supervised stepwise forward linear regression based on the methodology used in the <a href="http://www.escapeproject.eu/manuals/ESCAPE_Exposure-manualv9.pdf">ESCAPE study</a> . PyLUR records the starting model, all intermediate models including reasons for their acceptance or rejection, and the final model. For the final model PyLUR will also record the variance inflation factors, case summaries, DF Betas, and the spatial autocorrelation of the residuals.</p>
<p>PyLUR will also carry out a leave one out cross validation of the final model, the results of which are shown in the LOOCV_[dependent variable name]_[Date_Time].pdf file.</p>
<p>The next step is to apply the LUR model created with the Build LUR wizard to unmeasured points within the study area.</p>
