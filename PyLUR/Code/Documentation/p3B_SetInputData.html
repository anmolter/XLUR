  <h1 style="color:#4485b8; font-size:150%;font-weight:normal;">Set Input Data</h1>
  <h2 style="font-size:125%;font-weight:normal;">Line Feature Class</h2>
  <p>From the dropdown menu select the line feature class from which you would like to extract data. The line feature class should have a spatial extent that is larger than the study area and
     the largest buffer distance combined. The line feature class must contain a text field, which identifies a category for each line. If the feature class contains only one category, a dummy text field should
    be created with all rows set to the same text string. If the Length weighted value or Length * Value aggregation method will be used, the line feature class must also contain a numeric field.</p>
  <h2 style="font-size:125%;font-weight:normal;">Category Field</h2>
  <p>From the dropdown menu select the text field, which identifies the category of each line. If the feature class contains only one category, select a dummy text field in which
  all rows are set to the same text string. </p>
  <h2 style="font-size:125%;font-weight:normal;">Aggregation Method</h2>
  <p>Select the aggregation method to be used for this predictor variable.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Total length</em> - This will calculate the sum of all line lengths within each buffer and category. <a href="p3_TypeOfPredictor.html#pB" target="blank">Click here</a>
      for further details. </li>
    <li><em>Length weighted value</em> - This will calculate a length weighted value within each buffer and category. <a href="p3_TypeOfPredictor.html#pB" target="blank">Click here</a>
        for further details.
    <li><em>Length * Value</em> - This will multiply the length of each polygon with a user selected value field. <a href="p3_TypeOfPredictor.html#pB" target="blank">Click here</a>
          for further details.
  </ul>
  <h2 style="font-size:125%;font-weight:normal;">Value Field</h2>
  <p>From the dropdown menu select the numeric field to be used in the Length weighted value or Length * Value aggregation method. If this field contains missing data, then lines with missing values may be extracted in the
    intersect analysis. Please be aware that the Length weighted value and Length * Value aggregation methods will ignore rows with missing data and the calculated value will be based on the non-missing data only.
    After a field has been selected a green tick mark will appear.</p>
